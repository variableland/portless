# Changelog (fork)

Release notes for `@variablelab/portless`. Upstream's own history is in [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).

## 0.0.3

<!-- release:start -->

Based on upstream [portless v0.15.6](https://github.com/vercel-labs/portless/releases/tag/v0.15.6) (upstream `main` at `1ad573b`), the same base as 0.0.2.

### Fixed

- **Wildcard subdomains go to the closest registered parent**: with `--wildcard`, when several registered hostnames are parents of a request (for example `acme.localhost` and `feat-x.acme.localhost` for `tenant.feat-x.acme.localhost`), the closest one now serves it regardless of registration order, and a longer `--path` prefix on a farther parent no longer takes the request from it. If the closest parent has no route for the path, the proxy answers 404 instead of falling through to a farther parent. Upstream issue [vercel-labs/portless#380](https://github.com/vercel-labs/portless/issues/380), fixed in [#4](https://github.com/variableland/portless/pull/4).

<!-- release:end -->

## 0.0.2

Based on upstream [portless v0.15.6](https://github.com/vercel-labs/portless/releases/tag/v0.15.6) (upstream `main` at `1ad573b`), unchanged since 0.0.1.

### Changed

- Releases are published through npm trusted publishing (GitHub OIDC) instead of a long-lived token. This release is the first to use it.
- Fixed the `contributors` entry in `package.json` so npm shows the maintainer's name and profile url correctly.

## 0.0.1

First release of the fork, based on upstream [portless v0.15.6](https://github.com/vercel-labs/portless/releases/tag/v0.15.6) (upstream `main` at `1ad573b`).

### Added

- **Path-based routing**: `--path <prefix>` on `portless run` and `portless <name>`, the `PORTLESS_PATH` environment variable, and the `path` field in `portless.json` and in the `"portless"` key of `package.json`. Several apps can share one hostname; the proxy dispatches by the longest prefix that matches at a `/` boundary and forwards the full path to the backend. `alias`, `get`, and `list` understand prefixes, and the 404 page lists them. Proposed upstream in [vercel-labs/portless#165](https://github.com/vercel-labs/portless/pull/165).

### Changed

- Published as `@variablelab/portless`. The installed command is still `portless`.
- The npm tarball now includes `LICENSE` and `NOTICE`.
